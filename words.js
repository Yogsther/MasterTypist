const sorcerers_stone = ["They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.","Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache.","Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors.","The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.","The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him.","When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country.","Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.","None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.","There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light.","Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror.","Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.","But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about.","He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.",".. yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.","Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning.","He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more.","He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.","He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin.","It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.","He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.","He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind.","He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name.","He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry.","He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs.",".. but all the same, those people in cloaks... He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.","Dursley around the middle and walked off. Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger.","Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.","Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise.",".. Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her.","While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden.","The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did.","Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.","... How very wrong he was. Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness.","It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead.","In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.","The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive.","He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.","This man's name was Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome.","He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street.","She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.","Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something.",". all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy? It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him.","If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide.","He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two.","He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.","Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs.","Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley.","Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.","The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.","There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door.","He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.","When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents.","It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike.","Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast.","Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age.","He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was.","Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose.","The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.","About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut.","Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon.","He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head.","Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.","At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR.","He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.","Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies.","Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there.","The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned.","Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr.","Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them.","Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life.","His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.","The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.","Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.","On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens.","Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney.","The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings.","But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors.","It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs.","It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond.","They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.","It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone.","In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.","The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.","It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.","Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.","Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash.","This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all.","His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.","Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too.","A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley.","After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything.","At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.","By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs.","Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day.","Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader.","When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with Dudley.","Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too.","Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.","One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs.","She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years.","They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.","As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life.","Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.","There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink.","Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform.","Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him.","Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.","His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.","Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint.","Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.","It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him.","Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched.","From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't want him in there... I need that room.","Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet.","Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back.","Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it.","Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.","After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand.","Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter.","Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail. He had a plan. The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning.","Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.","He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first.","Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do.","He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.","On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.","Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out.","While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.","They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.","By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.","Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.","... They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.","Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again.","The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.","Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.","There were only two rooms. Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas.","He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail.","Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all. As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them.","Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows.","She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.","The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger.","Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time.","He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.","Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did.","Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow.","Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? One minute to go and he'd be eleven.","two... one... BOOM. The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.","A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.","The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame.","Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.","Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.","It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath.","With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter.",", Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.","Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't decide which to ask first.","With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter.","Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weather's horrible. Hope you're Well. Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm.","Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone. Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.","See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was.","Dark days, Harry. Didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches.",".. maybe he just wanted 'em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago.","Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.","Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's the biggest myst'ry, see.","Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it.","People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of 'em came outta kinda trances. Don~ reckon they could've done if he was comin' back.","Now he came to think about it... every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry.",".. chased by Dudley's gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow back.","He's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won't know himself.","When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers.","Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.","Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do.","They snapped me wand in half an' everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.","Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open.","The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn't wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid's coat.","Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.","Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.","Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn't blame them.","He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.","Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all.","In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.","For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry.","One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut.","The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.","Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.","It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.","Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.","He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping.","The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet.","So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there.","About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.","There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these.","The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.","Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.","Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches.","It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them.","Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering.","Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped.","How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.","They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners.","They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.","Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat.","One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money.","Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.","Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.","Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages.","Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing.","A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait.","For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.","An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.","We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same.","And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr.","It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar.","Ollivander bowed them from his shop. The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty.","Ollivander... but I don't know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for.","Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. just be yerself. I know it's hard.","Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.","His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased.","It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice.","Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.","On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television.","All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother.","He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.","Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.","They reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him.","Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.","All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig.","The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose.","Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one.","In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic.","Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley.","He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.","At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.","Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.","It looked very solid. He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten.",".. he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people.","Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs.","Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.","The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats.","Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door.","He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.","He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it.","Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window.","Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.","Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny.","Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first.","You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat.","Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.","What she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs.","Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life.","Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.","It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).","Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore's face had disappeared.","Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them.","Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.","He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.","The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.","The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.","She said all this very fast. Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either.","for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.","... Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon.","My dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd.","He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.","Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop.","He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.","Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.","My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.","It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.","He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.","The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform.","It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much.","Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.","Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.","They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.","The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.","They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.","The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts.","You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.","While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points.","At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.","He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need.","Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue.","He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.","Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.","These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.","Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.","The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver.","Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars.","On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty.","You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all.","There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.","If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.","He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.","He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.","Ron groaned. A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous.","He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet.","He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up.","Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore.","Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.","Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.","Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. Harry looked down at his empty gold plate.","He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet.","He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.","The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked.","Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.","He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.","When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before.","Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go.","Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.","Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.","Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.","Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.","They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.","A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.","Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.","He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny.","He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all.","People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.","Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending.","It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.","The ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open.","Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class.","He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.","She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later.","Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts.","The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.","And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.","They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets.","Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.","Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk.","At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.","Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross.","After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle.","The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke.","His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days.","Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards.","There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start. Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron.","They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.","Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls.","This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate.","Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week.","Send us an answer back with Hedwig. Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.","It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.","Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.","Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth.","He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.","A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.","He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like.","He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon.","Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes.","Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.","Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.","While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.","Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.","Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.","He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.","Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package.","Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan.","He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick.","Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom.","Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer.","Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.","Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one.","Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.","At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages.","Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.","Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.","Malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.","Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.","It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.","The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground.","Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.","Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all.","Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.","His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.","He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.","Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin.","He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice.","He hadn't even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him.","She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore.","He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant.","His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.","He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.","There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.","The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage.","All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing).","A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows.","Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.","Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting.","Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.","Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.","They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs.","Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.","Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them.","Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room.","They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.","They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor.","And now they knew why it was forbidden. They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor.","It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.","It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.","CHAPTER TEN HALLOWEEN Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.","In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.","Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.","All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.","As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.","Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor.","It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one.","Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session.","Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night.","He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.","Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.","As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field.","Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on.","Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground.","you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.","He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers. At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face.","That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers unless they crack my head open.","It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it.","You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win.","Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.","The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.","On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors.","Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom.","Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye).","Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this.","Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.","A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter.","Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.","They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. It was a horrible sight.","Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut.","It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible.","It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside.","It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic.","Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside. Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint.","The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise.","Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.","The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.","Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind.","The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.","Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.","They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars.","A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear.","Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.","Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry.","Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone.","Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble.","Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them.","CHAPTER ELEVEN QUIDDITCH As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel.","Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.","If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship. Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret.","Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.","The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.","They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping.","Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.","Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them.","Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow.","Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.","He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try.","Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages.","The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.","By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars.","The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.","Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined.","It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath.","Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors. Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).","Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.","Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.","Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air.","Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood's game plan.","Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too.","His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees.","He'd never felt anything like that. It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off.","He couldn't turn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.",".. The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's broom was behaving strangely.","Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.","Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.","Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer.","They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.","Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione.","The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban.","The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.","No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.","Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.","Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick.","So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family. It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.","Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once.","and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.","Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.","Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random.","Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one.","These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.","He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel.","They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to.","Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful.","They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing.","What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks. Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.","Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel.","They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire.","Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle.","However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.","Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing.","When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.","Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid.","A second, very small parcel contained a note. We received your message and enclose your Christmas present.","Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it. Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds.","It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. A Very Merry Christmas to you. There was no signature.","These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside.","Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice.","Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.","Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice.","The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.","It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day.","Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.","Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it. His father's... this had been his father's.","He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.","He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows.","Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.","He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.","And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.","Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.","The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.","They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand.","Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled.","Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.","He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book.","A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.","He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going.","Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.","He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything.","They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away.","That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.","It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.","He stepped in front of it. He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around.","A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him.","It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did. Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.","He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. How long he stood there, he didn't know.","The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.","He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel.","They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.","That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone.","And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily.","Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family.","He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.","You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them.","However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.","If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.","Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't. He started having nightmares.","Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.","Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks.","Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again. Wood was working the team harder than ever.","Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side.","If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years.","Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.","... The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess.","Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.","He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower. Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse.","Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas.","She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.","The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.","There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr.","It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.","As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione.","Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again.","This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.","Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match.","Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard. Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe.","There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching. Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.","Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.","Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.","Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.","Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.","Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape.... And speaking of Snape... A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle.","Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched.","Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed. The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone.","He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.","He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.","Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever.","In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd cracked yet.","Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes.","It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements.","Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.","When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed.","Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.","Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour.","But Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire. So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.","He had written only two words: It's hatching. Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut.","Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.","Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning break.","When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest.","They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath. All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open.","Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.","Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous.","Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy.","The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.","The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak.","He had been down at Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.","I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit.","Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon. Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark.","The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert's fangs were poisonous. Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.","It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall.","Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.","Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away.","Not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again.","They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.","They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.","At last, Norbert was going... going... gone. They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them.","Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other.","Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already. Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong.","Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It's one o'clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.","In one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.","How could they ever make up for this? Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours.","Harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn.","What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they'd done? At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there'd been a mistake.","From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated.","Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup.","Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him.","Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.","Harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery.","He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.","... Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpected test.","Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead.","He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.","Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard.","Filch wouldn't help us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think.","And don't forget, we're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That'll take a lot of explaining.","Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost.","He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't say a word.",".. hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed.","Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.","The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut.","There's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday.","Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least.","He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened.","Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground.","He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm.","Harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others? At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return.","Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke.","Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.","Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer. It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead.","Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.","... Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast.","Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.","Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.","The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone.","He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead.","They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore.","They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.","Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake.",".. and Voldemort's waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich.","... They must show that Voldemort's coming back.... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.","But the night's surprises weren't over. When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them.","Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.","It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.","They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk.","Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.","Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest.","Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry.","The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.","Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out.","When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest.","The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows.","Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry.","Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy.",".. so I told him... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an' then... I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks.","... Let's see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if I wanted.",".. but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home.... So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy.","They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.","I don't know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protected.","This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break.","Harry and Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.","Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom.","His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.","But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them.","As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything.","They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.","Harry pushed the door open. As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them.","It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath.","In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.","Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips.","With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom.","As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.","Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.","In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.","The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank.","He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched.","He pulled the handle, but it was locked. The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.","Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't.","After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.","Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber. They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand.","The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.","They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone.","The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.","Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.","He looked as if he'd been knocked out. Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet.","They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.","Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.","She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.","Funny, really... he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular.","Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.","Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.","... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.","What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does.","Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban.","Dare he make a break for it? But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn't moving his lips.","Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away.","Quirrell's head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot. Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound.","Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen.","... Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest.",".. she was trying to protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.",".. down... down... Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.","He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange. He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.","I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat.","No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.","No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left.","He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.","However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you'll forgive me.","Not today. Not now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older.","He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign.",".. to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever.","It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason.","... I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even.","My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets.","I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help.","I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could.","As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.","He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full.","It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row.","A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table. When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once.","What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts.","Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him.","Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot.","This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.","It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls.","Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too."];
